  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at postgraduate students and other scientists
  who are familiar with basic programming concepts (like loops,
  conditionals, arrays, and functions) but need help to translate this
  knowledge into practical tools to help them work more
  productively.  In the first instance, attendance will be restricted
  to people who work at Cambridge University and affiliated institutions.
